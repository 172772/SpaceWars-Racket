##Instructions
One player must survive while the other perishes. You can move around the environment only by rotating your ship and using your thrusters. Beware of the planets; their gravity will pull you in, and colliding with them will result in instant death. Also, don't fly too far out into space, you may never come back! You have up to three active bullets at once to attempt to destroy the enemy ship. Using your thrusters and performing 180 degree turns use up your fuel gauge, which regenerates slowly.

##Ways To Die
* Crashing into a planet
* Crashing into the other player
* Being flung out into space
* Colliding with projectile, either your own or your opponent's
